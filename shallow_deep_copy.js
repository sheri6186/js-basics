// A shallow copy creates a new array, but it only copies the references of nested objects or arrays, not their actual values. Changes to nested objects or arrays in the copied array will affect the original array.
// A deep copy creates a completely independent copy of the array, including all nested objects or arrays. Changes to the copied array will not affect the original array.
